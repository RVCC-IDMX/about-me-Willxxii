       <h1>Biography</h1>

        <div>
            <p>My name is Will Sisler, I am currently attending Raritan Valley Community College and will be transferring to the University of Vermont in the spring. I have lived in the greater Princeton New Jersey area since I was born, and can remember a field trip I took to the RVCC planetarium way back in third grade. I love watching movies, and I am interested in pursuing a career in cinematography. My favorite movie is probably Terry Gilliam’s 1998 psychedelic comedy-drama, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, based on the book written by Hunter S. Thompson. One day I would like to make my own movie and enter it into film festivals/ competitions to see what people think. I would also like to continue my passion for photography at my next school. I loved my photography classes throughout high school, and they had a big impact on my decision to study TV and film production. Although web development was never really in my long-term plan, it was always something I kept in the back of my head. I recall trying to use scratch back in fourth grade because I didn't know how else to start coding, however, I never really continued with it. Years later, and after a semester of IDMX-225, I am proud to share with the world my About Me website.</p>

        <h4>An Excerpt From Pride and Predjudice</h4>

        <div>
        <p>There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been his design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on.</p>

        <p>Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.</p>

        <p>They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.</p>

        <p>Every thing being settled between them, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.</p>

        <p>On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.</p>

        <p>They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times, but this is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.</p>

       <h1>Biography</h1>

        <div>
            <p>My name is Will Sisler, I am currently attending Raritan Valley Community College and will be transferring to the University of Vermont in the spring. I have lived in the greater Princeton New Jersey area since I was born, and can remember a field trip I took to the RVCC planetarium way back in third grade. I love watching movies, and I am interested in pursuing a career in cinematography. My favorite movie is probably Terry Gilliam’s 1998 psychedelic comedy-drama, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, based on the book written by Hunter S. Thompson. One day I would like to make my own movie and enter it into film festivals/ competitions to see what people think. I would also like to continue my passion for photography at my next school. I loved my photography classes throughout high school, and they had a big impact on my decision to study TV and film production. Although web development was never really in my long-term plan, it was always something I kept in the back of my head. I recall trying to use scratch back in fourth grade because I didn't know how else to start coding, however, I never really continued with it. Years later, and after a semester of IDMX-225, I am proud to share with the world my About Me website.</p>

        <h4>Blog Article: Roadtripping/ How to embedd static google maps</h4>

        <div>
        <p>Ever since I was young I've been in love with cars and driving. The combination of these passions naturally led me to the idea of road-tripping, which got me equally as excited. When I was little my Boy Scout troop held several overnight camping trips, usually in local parks. I always liked the outdoors and as I grew up, I looked for other ways to incorporate these things I loved so much into my life. There were even a few times when my dad let me use the back of his old SUV to camp outside my house overnight. In the summer of 2017, my father and I went on a New England road trip that spanned just over a week and a half. He prefers comfort over camping so we drove through each state going hotel to hotel. Now that I’ve reached the age where I can do these things by myself, I believe it is time for me to plan my maiden voyage and get out into the world. Now let's say that you, the audience reading this, also wanted to plan a road trip; And perhaps, you also wanted to embed said road trip map into a website you were creating… What follows is a step-by-step tutorial on how to make thy road trip map, and how to embedd thus map into thy site.</p>

        <p>The first step (1) in this process is finding out where you’d like to go. If you are looking for a simple, one-destination trip, head over to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps" target="_self" title="A link to Google Maps">Google Maps</a>. Type in your desired destination in the search bar, and hit enter.
            Alternatively, If you are looking to make multiple stops and fully plan out your trip, I suggest using <a href="https://www.google.com/mymaps" target="_self" title="A link to Google My Maps">Google My Maps</a>. Using this platform is incredibly easy to start up and get into. Just search for your first stop and click the Add Destination button. Continue this step repeatedly for each location you would like to visit. Also be sure to check YouTube for more in-depth tutorials on Google My Maps, if you need additional help. 
            </p>

        <p>The next step (2) is to select the “Share” button, which appears in the pop-up window for your destination.</p>

        <p>(3) After that, select the “Embedd a map” tap. If done correctly, you should be looking at a preview of the map. Above the map is the HTML iframe code, and a drop-down menu presenting the different map size presets you can choose from. Note that the size window your map takes up on a page can be adjusted later in V.S. Code.</p>

        <p>Finally (4), select the “COPY HTML” box to the right of the given code (or carefully select and copy it yourself), and paste it into your intended section, within your index.html file.
        </p>

        <p>Although this is all that is needed to get the map to appear on your site, remember that you need to style the iframe appropriately to make it responsive in all media states and match your desired color scheme. </p>
